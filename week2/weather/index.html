                <h4>A Weather Experience</h4>
                <span>By Prince C. Chukwu</span>
                <p>To tell the truth, as far as I am concerned, “bad weather” could mean only one thing to me, and that
                    is “cold’ weather. But, no matter how I dislike this “cold” weather, I do have to experience it
                    every year, just like I did about a few years ago. <br><br>

                    As I have already mentioned earlier, I don’t really like cold weather, especially, if it is
                    associated with fog. But, I am pretty sure that Mother Nature doesn’t really care whether I like it
                    or not, just as it didn’t on a December morning about a few years ago when I needed to drop my uncle
                    at the airport. <br><br>
                    As soon as I woke up in that morning and took a peek through the window, I immediately knew that it
                    was going to be a “rough ride” on the roam for us as I could see fog all over. <a class="showStory" onclick="showStory()">Read full article ...</a></p>
                <p class="story">Still, I took my old car and hit the road after wearing all kinds of warm clothes to protect me from
                    the onslaught of a cold winter morning in order to reach the airport as early as possible. But,
                    despite my best efforts and intention, I was not able to reach the airport on time, because the
                    traffic on the road was too slow due to too much fog and low visibility of the road. <br><br>

                    In fact, my uncle and I gave up the idea of catching the flight, but we still took a chance and
                    arrived at the airport anyway. Luckily, the airport authority had understood the gravity of the
                    situation, due to the bad weather on that day, and decided to delay the flight. <br><br>

                    Anyway, we were lucky to catch the flight, in the end, thanks to the airport authority, but we had
                    to go through a lot of concern and frustration on the road because of bad weather, caused by extreme
                    fog. Even worse, I even felt very nervous and scared as I almost was going to have an accident
                    because of low visibility on the road. So, it was indeed a bad experience for me.
