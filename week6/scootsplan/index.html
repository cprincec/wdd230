        <hr>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p> The Purpose of this website is to promote the rental services for those customers that like to do their
            homework before getting to the island and to provide information about the services, requirements, and
            rental processes of the scoots rental company. The website reflects the fun and carefree attitude of the island and the ability to
            escape the touristy western part of the island by exploring the vast coasts and inlets on the southern and
            eastern shores.</p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Our target audience includes teenagers, young adults and the middle-aged who seek to have water related
            recreational activity or stress relieving, exploring or simply fun and exciting activity. This audience is
            sought after with sensitivity to their varying financial strengths, expressed in our tailoring of our
            services to accommodate students, workers and pensioners. This very well includes those who have had the
            worst experience in rafting and those who are yet to have their first grip of a rafting pedal. This site
            demonstrates our fervent commitment to really reach out to our diverse audience by its accessibility on
            mobiles phones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers. </p> <!-- change this -->

            The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related
            and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
            child pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page,
            it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.

        <h2>
            Wireframes
        </h2>
        <p>
            Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the major sections of content that will
            be on the page and the relative locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will be
            6 sections to our page:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation
                bar.</li>
            <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
            <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
            <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
            <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
            <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media icons. </li>

        </ol>
